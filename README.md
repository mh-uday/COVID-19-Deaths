# COVID-19 Global Deaths Analysis

### Project Overview

This project presents an analysis of global COVID-19 deaths using case and population data across various countries and continents. The insights were visualized in a dashboard format and supported by SQL-based data extraction. This documentation outlines the key metrics, visualizations, and interpretations derived from the data to help understand the pandemic’s impact worldwide.


### Data Sources

The Primary dataset use for this project is the "CovidDeaths.csv", "CovidVaccinations.csv" file containing detailed informations.
The accompanying SQL query was used to extract data, SQL file "SQLQuery.sql".


### Tools

- SQL Server – for querying and aggregating raw data.
- Tableau  for interactive visualizations. 


### Findings

1. Infection Rates by Country: A choropleth map visualizes the percentage of the population infected in each country, ranging from 0% to over 17%. Darker shades indicate higher infection percentages. The United States and parts of Europe show significantly high infection rates.

2. Total Deaths by Continent: A bar chart comparison shows the total COVID-19 deaths by continent.
    
     - Europe: Highest death toll, over 1 million.

     - North America: Second highest.

     - South America & Asia: Moderate levels.

     - Africa & Oceania: Significantly lower totals.

3. Infection Trends Over Time: The line chart displays how the percent of population infected evolved monthly for key countries.
     
     - United States shows a steep rise, nearing 10% by early 2021.

     - United Kingdom follows with approximately 6-7%.

     - Mexico ends around 1.78%.

     - India and China show slower growth, under 1%.
  

### Conclusion

This project illustrates the global spread and fatality of COVID-19 with emphasis on geographic and temporal patterns. Europe and the Americas bore the highest death tolls, while infection rates varied greatly by country. These insights are for understanding the pandemic’s progression and guiding future public health policies.
